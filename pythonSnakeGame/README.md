The classic Snake game program built in Python.

### Prerequisites

Python (latest is the best)
Terminal
PyGame package

### Installing

To get Python on your desktop, download the latest build from this official site:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you have Windows, I would recommend using JetBrains Python IDE (PyCharm), from this site:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows  

To install PyGame package, type "python install pygame" in your PyCharm's terminal. 

## Running the tests

To run the code use this command (if you are using Pycharm):
```
python main.py
```
The program basically runs the classic Snake game.
