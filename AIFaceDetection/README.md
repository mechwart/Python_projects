# AI Face Detection with Python

A face-detection program built in Python.  

### Prerequisites

Python (latest is the best)
Terminal
OpenCV

### Installing

To get Python on your desktop, download the latest build from this official site:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you have Windows, I would recommend using JetBrains Python IDE (PyCharm), from this site:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows  

To install OpenCV, type "python install opencv-python" in your PyCharm's terminal. Also download to your project directory this file 
Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

## Running the tests

To run the code use this command (if you are using Pycharm):
```
python Face_Detection.py
```
The program basically searching faces and draw a rectangle around it. It can search faces using your webcamera, or in a manually given file like videos or images.
