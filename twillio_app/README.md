# Twillio App

It sends a SMS via a verified given phone number to your phone.

### Prerequisites

Python (latest is the best)  
Terminal  
Twilio Account  

### Installing

To get Python on your desktop, download the latest build from this official site:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Sign up to create a Twilio Account on this site: 
https://www.twilio.com/

If you have Windows, I would recommend using JetBrains Python IDE (PyCharms), from this site:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

## Running the tests

After you created an account ,copy the Account SID, Auth Token, Trial Number and paste with replacing the 'X' and '#'  in the credentials.py.

To run the code and get a SMS on your phone use this command (if you are using Pycharm):
```
python send_sms.py
```
