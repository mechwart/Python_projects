# Amazon Price Tracker

A search term based, product's price tracker built in Python.  

### Prerequisites

Python (latest is the best)  
Terminal  
Webdriver ( I would prefer Chrome's webdriver)  

### Installing

To get Python on your desktop, download the latest build from this official site:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you have Windows, I would recommend using JetBrains Python IDE (PyCharms), from this site:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows  

If you want to use ChromeDriver (Chrome's webdriver), download that package, which Chrome version you have, also choose the right package based on your OP(operation system).  
Link for the ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads  
## Running the tests

To run the code use this command (if you are using Pycharm):
```
python simple_tracker.py
```
The program basically fetching the data of the searched term then put the result of search into the reports directory in a json file.
